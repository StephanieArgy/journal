      <p>In Primer Pro, our first JavaScript/jQuery assignment started with us having to make a repository and establish a remote on github.com.  "This should be review," said the instructions.</p>
      <p>
                  Also, in Primer Basic, we did our group project, and the assignment description included this swell little cheatsheet on using Github with a team. If this were on paper, it would be all tattered and dog-eared from having been used so much. In our repository, we had a master branch and a gh-pages branch, and each of also had our own personal branch on our local drive, where we would do our individual work. Then, here are the instructions we were given on how to put it all together:

                  <blockquote>

                  <h3>Workflow</h3>

                    <p>Do your work on your branch. When you are ready to share your work with the team, do the following steps:</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>switch to the master branch ("git checkout master")</li>
                        <li>pull from github to bring in your team's work ("git pull")</li>
                        <li>switch to your branch ("git checkout mybranch")</li>
                        <li>merge from master to your branch ("git merge master")</li>
                        <li>resolve any merge conflicts that may happen using your editor</li>
                        <li>switch to the master branch ("git checkout master")</li>
                        <li>merge from your branch to master ("git merge mybranch")</li>
                        <li>push your changes to github ("git push")</li>
                      </ul>
                  </blockquote>

        Best. Thing. Ever.
